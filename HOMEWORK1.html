<td>BY EMMANUEL ROMERO LA. Ciceo Richad Zere Professor Richard Zare in his lab. Whether it's the summer grass that tickles your feet or the red Bordeaux smacking on your palate, nearly every part of the world around you carrics special chemical markers. These markers, called isotopes, can tell scientists where the molecules that corngase a substance are from, where they traveled and what happened to them along the way. But doing these analyses has been complex and costly. Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new method to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.</td>
