<h1>Patrick Young</h1>

<p>I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department. Before coming to Stanford I spent two years as a
 programmer at Taligent(now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product
 designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for
 Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycle from initial product conception through the actual product
 launch
 </p>
 <p>I have a Ph.D. from the University of Califomia, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering. My dissertation was on
 process support for software engineering teams. I also have a masters degree from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial
 Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering
  </p>
  <p>At Irvine, I taught Introduction to Software Engineering, sophomore core class, and Software Processes, a graduate
 seminar. I also worked as a peer academic advisor, a freshmen orientation advisor, and served on leadership for campus
 chapters of both Habitat for Humanity and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship.
